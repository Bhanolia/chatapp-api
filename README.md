# Chat App API

This project is a backend API for a chat application developed using TypeScript. It provides the necessary functionality for user registration, authentication, real-time messaging, and chat room management. The API is built with Express.js and utilizes WebSockets for real-time communication. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication and authorization.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- README.md                    (Project documentation)
```

The main directories and files in the project structure are described as follows:

- **src**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **controllers**: Handles API request handling and processing.
  - **models**: Defines data models and database schemas.
  - **routes**: Defines the API routes and maps them to corresponding controllers.
  - **services**: Contains the business logic and external service integrations.
  - **utils**: Provides utility functions and helper modules.
  - **app.ts**: Initializes the Express app and sets up middleware, routes, and error handling.

- **tests**: Holds unit tests and integration tests for the application.

- **config**: Contains configuration files for different environments.

- **db**: Includes database-related files such as migrations and seeds.

- **public**: Holds static files like CSS, images, or client-side JavaScript files.
